The project targets the current queueing issues by providing a dynamic Android application to display the number of people in the queue for any businesses available in Google Maps based on a collaborative input. Additionally, to encourage user collaboration, virtual awards will be available (such as avatars, utilizing gamification techniques). The application can also provide metrics related to peak hours and more for the involved businesses (using the data stored in Google Cloud). Moreover, the application could be used as an advertisement channel between business and customers, providing promotions at first hand (using push notifications).

### This application is using:

* Java
- Android
+ Cloud Firestore
* Google API
